# GreedyMeshing
First attempt at creating a 3D voxel rendering engine using GreedyMeshing.
* Voxel chunk loading
* Voxel rendering optimized by GreedyMeshing
* Simple lighting
* Simple SSAO shader
* Voxel model loading
* Voxel world saving and loading
* Place and destroy voxels
* 1st/3rd person camera
* Simple collision detection
